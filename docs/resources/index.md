# Resources

Most of the resources can be sent as message. Check the [messages](../messages/index.md) for detailed info.

But there are some resources which act more like a component, not being used alone by themself.

There are also, resources which can be used alone, and as components for other messages types, like the `Text` resource.

Such resources, and where they are used, are listed bellow:
| Resource                    | Documentation                | Used at                                                                              |
